# Alex's C Compiler

Welcome! ACC is a work-in-progress implementation of a C11 compiler, written in C.
This is a hobby project I started to brush up on C, and learn more about compilers.

The goals of ACC are:
 * Hand-coded everything, including scanner/lexer and recursive-descent parser
 * Well documented design and implementation
 * Thoroughly tested

Optimizations are a nice-to-have, as is portability: ACC will support only
one platform - probably x86, and is not designed with extensibility/porting in mind.
